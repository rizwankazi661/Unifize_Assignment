##  Technical Decisions

- Created **`Button`** and **`Avatar`**  as reusable, modular components to ensure consistency, streamline maintenance, and minimize code duplication across the application
- Added test cases for respective components.
- Used `module.css` to scope styles locally to components, preventing global CSS conflicts.
- Created a **`constants`** file to store all static text in one centralized location, improving maintainability and ensuring consistency across the application.
