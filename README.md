## ðŸ“Œ Technical Decisions

- Designed and implemented **`Button`** and **`Avatar`** as reusable components to ensure consistency, enhance maintainability, and eliminate redundant code. 
- Added test cases for respective components.
- Used `module.css` to scope styles locally to components, preventing global CSS conflicts.
- Created a **`constants`** file to store all static text in one centralized location, improving maintainability and ensuring consistency across the application.
